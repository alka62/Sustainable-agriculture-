🌱 Sustainable Agriculture Project – Week 1
Crop Recommendation System (Machine Learning)
📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the Sustainable Agriculture course project.
In Week 1, we focused on building a Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning.
The system recommends the best crop to grow based on soil and climatic conditions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy – Data Handling

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization

📂 Dataset
We used the Crop Recommendation Dataset (from Kaggle).
It contains:

Soil nutrients (N, P, K)

Environmental features (Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall)

Crop label (recommended crop)

📑 Steps Completed in Week 1
Dataset Loading

Uploaded and read the dataset.

Checked dataset shape and columns.

Data Preprocessing

Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder.

Identified target column (label or crop).

Model Training

Split dataset into train (80%) and test (20%).

Trained a Random Forest Classifier.

Model Evaluation

Achieved accuracy score on test data.

Visualization

Plotted crop distribution using Seaborn.

📊 Results
Model Accuracy: ~95% (approx, may vary depending on dataset split)

Balanced crop distribution across different categories.
